[00:24.02] I walked across an empty land
[00:29.44] I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
[00:34.96] I felt the earth beneath my feet
[00:40.67] Sat by the river and it made me complete
[01:00.67] 
[00:46.19] Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
[00:51.78] I'm gettin' old, and I need something to rely on
[00:57.32] So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
[01:02.92] I'm gettin' tired, and I need somewhere to begin
[01:26.92] 
[01:08.78] I came across a fallen tree
[01:14.08] I felt the branches of it looking at me
[01:19.40] Is this the place we used to love?
[01:25.10] Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?
[01:47.60] 
[01:30.86] Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
[01:36.33] I'm gettin' old, and I need something to rely on
[01:42.06] So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
[01:47.42] I'm gettin' tired, and I need somewhere to begin
[02:11.42] 
[01:53.45] And if you have a minute, why don't we go
[01:59.35] Talk about it somewhere only we know?
[02:04.98] This could be the end of everything
[02:09.57] So, why don't we go
[02:19.07] 
[02:12.16] Somewhere only we know?
[02:17.87] Somewhere only we know
[02:28.87] 
[02:26.56] Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
[02:32.32] I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
[02:37.92] So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
[02:43.55] I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
[03:07.55] 
[02:49.34] And if you have a minute, why don't we go
[02:55.38] Talk about it somewhere only we know?
[03:00.85] This could be the end of everything
[03:05.49] So, why don't we go?
[03:08.12] So, why don't we go?
[03:18.12] 
[03:13.98] Ooh, hey, hey
[03:19.53] Oh-oh-oh
[03:23.53] 
[03:23.38] This could be the end of everything
[03:27.95] So, why don't we go somewhere only we know?
[03:49.45] 
[03:35.83] Somewhere only we know
[03:41.67] Somewhere only we know
